## Project Summary

#### Title: Sacramento–San Joaquin Delta Environmental and Fish Community Analysis

This final project within the BIOE 276 Data Science for EEB course attempts to analyzes long term changes in temperature and salinity within the Sacramento–San Joaquin Delta and assesses how those environmental changes have contributed to overall changes in fish community assemblages. Using data from the Delta Juvenile Fish Monitoring Program Environmental Data Initiative (EDI), we explore these specific environemental trends over time and associations with fish species composition.
